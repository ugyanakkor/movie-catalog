## Installation

To install the packages, firstly install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), than run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

NOTE:
Here is my API key, which can be used for testing, or you can generate your own and setup:
9f0db0741fd44187850b6839d20e4b60

Replace the <API_KEY> in constants.ts

This is not secure solution, because never put an API key into version control, but in this case
this is not a production and I want to help you to setup the environment.
